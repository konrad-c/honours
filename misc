TODO:

I would suggest having a look through some of the journals and conference in this area to get a taste for what’s happening in the field (you’ll need to do this anyway as part of your literature review).

Some good places to start:
- IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computing
- GECCO Conference
- CEC Conference

You don’t need to look at every paper, so first check the title and abstract to see if its interesting/relevant.
If so, bookmark the paper and copy it to your bibliography (you should use a tool like BibDesk, EndNode, etc. or one of the on-line bibliographic tools)
Also, try to summarise the paper’s key message/contributions in your own words.
